This code was written by Tim Mattison.  It was done as a personal project to learn more about how [Guice](https://github.com/google/guice) can be used on large scale Java projects and how a codebase of that nature can be easily tested.

If you need this code for a commercial project you can contact me at tim (AT) mattison (DOT) org to discuss dual licensing.
